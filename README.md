# sir_lock
The implementation of lockdowns for the SIR model on small world networks; particularly for the large-deviation approach of obtaining the density of states.

This code is original but the idea serves as a continuation of the work published by Yannick Feld at https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.105.034313.
Yannick Feld should also be credited here, as he provided a lot of guidance in the development of the application.

Certain changes suggested by the referees were implemented to show they didnt make much difference. 
(should probably roll back to a version before 9/9/23.)
